# JavaMultiThreading

## Idea

I built this project to learn a little bit about java multithreading.

## Testing

When running under a single thread the average runtime was 7-8 seconds, 
with multithreads the program runs a good 4-4.5 seconds.

## Project

I created this project with C in mind and took it too far at first, 
once I learned how Java multithreading worked it was much simpler. 

## Conclusion

I set out to learn how multithreading works in java and I feel I've accomplished that.
I may return to this project in the future but for now I have acheived my goal.
